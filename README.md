This is a repository for resources completed as part of the Duke University Statistics with R Specialization.

To be successful in this specialization, learners have analyzed and
visualized data in R and created reproducible data analysis reports,
demonstrated a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of
statistical inference, performed frequentist and Bayesian statistical
inference and modeling to understand natural phenomena and make
data-based decisions, communicated statistical results correctly,
effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon, critiqued
data-based claims and evaluated data-based decisions.
